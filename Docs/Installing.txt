This mod uses BepinEx to modify the game code, like most Unity mods.
The release page for Bepin can be found here:
    https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases

Installing Bepin 5:
    Download and install version 5 to the same folder where you can see the game
    (Lethal Company.exe) If you don't know where that is right click on the game
    in steam, then "manage" then "browse local files" drag the files from the bepin
    zip right into this folder, all of the files. Run the game once and bepin will
    automatically run its first time setup (this will require no input from you).
    Once you're at the main menu, quit the game. Inside the BepinEx folder there
    will now be two folders you need to know about. "Plugins" and "Config".

Installing the Mod:
    Place this mod inside the plugins folder. It should look like 
    "Plugins/Flowerful/Enhancer.dll" and run the game again. The mod will create
    a brand new file called mom.llama.enhancer.cfg inside the "Config" folder that
    you can edit to change all the settings or even disable the mod entirely if you're
    playing online with other players that are not using the mod. I have left a lot
    of documentation about what each setting does as well as recommendations for
    what to set them at in the config file itself. All the defaults are basically the
    value the game uses so if you don't change anything the game will be basically
    the same.
